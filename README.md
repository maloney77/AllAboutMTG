# Coverage
Mtg Coverage Hub/ Team Site


Cranial Archive is a hub for coverage and will host a history of coverage from large events
This includes: SCG Opens, Grand Prix, Pro Tours, Eternal Weekend, etc. 

The site will have a database of these events, and will be searchable through deck, event, player, format.

Hopefully when the site is releasable, we can set up a patreon, and or gain sponsors through other means. 
I hope to have team jeresys for events, mats, and sleeves to not only act as a team, but to promote the site. 

I would like this to remain as the three of us. 
For Christian, it is a way to prepare for the new job and get acquainted with Angular
For Kyle, this is a fun and useful tool. 
For Wyatt, this will be a massive resume booster. 

I think we should be able to deliver a solid product and hopefully make something useful to the community. 

We have big brains, lets put them to use. 

Thx.
-Christian

EDIT 6/26:

Here is what I envision for the site
The home page will have a navbar with links to Home, About, Contact, Format(Dropdown Menu with Standard, Modern, Legacy, Limited, then a break and a link to other formats), and a search function (by deck, name, event, format)

The home page will have a link to the most recent standard event, most recent modern event, a random match, and top 8 matches of the month. 

The About will talk about the website and the team members so rn just us three, but potentiall more people 

When you click on a format button, it will take you to a screen that shows the events of that format from most recent to oldest, most likely seperated on different pages,
After you click on these events, you will be taken to a screen that shows all 20ish rounds with either a link or embedded video. 

The search function will bring you to a page that will list relevant results by: (FORMAT, DECK, PLAYER, EVENT)
So Like if your search "Jeskai"

Standard: Jeskai Flash
          Jeskai Black
          Jeskai Burn
          Jeskai Ascendency Combo
          
Modern:
        Jeskai Control
         JEskai Ascendency
         ...
Legacy:
        Jeskai Delver
        Jeskai Control
Vintage:
Pauper Ect.

Clicking on these decks shoudl bring you to a search page that has all of the mtches listed by event and name of player
